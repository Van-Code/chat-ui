Create a chat UI similar to Slack with a thread view. Channels panel is for visual purposes only. I used the React framework to speed up development. I chose React over other modern frameworks because React was mentioned in the job qualifications.

## Assumptions

Code project from scratch to show skills versus leveraging existing chat package.

## Future work should include:

- animate opening/closing thread panel and posting messages
- allow minimizing channels panel
- allow updating profile data
- add style to denote unread messages
- style reply button
- dsiplay private channels to members of group
- add tests

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
